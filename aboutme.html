    <h3>Nikhitha Kasuvojula</h3>
    <p>As a child, I always dreamed of making a positive contribution to society. At Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya,<br>
      I was taught to be curious and to appreciate the finer nuances of subjects. This led me to score an <br>
      impressive 10 CGPA in the board exams. Joining Sri Chaitanya Junior College gave me the inspiration I needed<br>
      to follow my dreams. Taking up Math, Physics and Chemistry laid the foundation for my degree in engineering. <br>
      With a good score of 97.3%, I went to the Gokaraju Rangaraju Institute of Engineering and Technology to pursue<br>
      Civil Engineering. My undergraduate program has given me broad and across-the-board exposure to core subjects <br>
      like Engineering Drawing, Engineering Mechanics, Building Materials and Construction Planning.And I am good at<br>
      arts and crafts, I really enjoy making something creative.
